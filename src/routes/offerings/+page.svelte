<h1>What can I do for you?</h1>

<h2>Simple to complex webapps</h2>
From simple apps to keep track of your spending to complex inventory systems, 
let's talk about what you need.  For something customer facing I'll need a figma (or similar) 
design from you. I can also work with a designer.

<h2>Webpages</h2>
I created everything on this webpage myself. From your design I can create your website with any custom or existing webapps you need. 
Single page or multiple pages, etc.  I code in Svelte/Javascript, but can also do React if needed.

<h2>Integrations between platforms</h2>
Do you have customer information in more than one platform (e.g. Mailchimp and Hubspot?) 
and you need a way to keep the information in sync when changes are made?  I can set up a integration for you.  
Simple integrations can be done through Zapier (and I can show you some tricks) -- and if your needs are more 
complex I can create a custom integration (assuming the platform has a public API).
