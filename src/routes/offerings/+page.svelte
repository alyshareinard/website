<h1>What can I do for you?</h1>

<h2>Simple to complex webapps</h2>
From simple apps to keep track of your kid's chores and allowance to complex inventory systems, 
let's talk about what you need.  For something customer facing I'll need a figma (or similar) 
design from you. I can also work with a designer.

<h2>Webpages</h2>
I created everything on this webpage myself.  I don't have strong design skills but with a 
figma design to work with, I can create the front and backend of your website. Single page or multiple pages, embedded webapps, etc.

<h2>Integrations between platforms</h2>
Do you have customer information in more than one platform (e.g. Mailchimp and Hubspot?) 
and you need a way to keep the information in sync when changes are made?  I can set up a
Zapier integration for you -- and if your needs are more complex I can set up direct links 
to the platform APIs.
