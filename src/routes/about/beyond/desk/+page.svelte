<h1>
    The story of my desk
</h1>

<h4>
    After a few years of working from home I needed to upgrade my workspace -- in particular, I wanted a standing desk.
    I got a beautiful one and I was very happy.

<h4>
    Well, at least for the first 3 weeks.  Then, one day as I was raising the desk, it caught on this small button on the wall.

<h4>
And... tragedy.
</h4>

<h4>
    The glass top shattered into a million pieces. Cleanup took hours. My beautiful desk was ruined.  
</h4>
<h4>Or was it?</h4>
<h4>The mechanism still worked fine, it just needed a new top.  I could go to the hardware store and get a piece of 
    wood cut to the right dimensions -- but I didn't want to do that.  Looking around I saw our wine rack and 
    thought about the old wine crates we had in the storage room...

<h4>
    After some gluing and sanding and varnishing (plus adding supports using the uglier pieces of wood) I had a new desktop.

<h4>
    It turned out better than I expected!
