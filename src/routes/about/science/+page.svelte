Work Experience and Selected Publications
</h3>

<h4>
2013-2018: Research Scientist III. University of Colorado, based at the Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).
</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
Project Scientist for GONG Space Weather transition to Operations. Responsible for coordinating the transition of GONG H-alpha and magnetogram processing to SWPC. 
    </li><li>
SWPC Ground System Deputy and Deputy Program Scientist for the DSCOVR mission. Responsible for working with the National Geophysical Data Center to set up the data archive, for ensuring that SWPC met ground system requirements and filling in as needed for the Program Scientist.
</li><li>
GOES algorithm development. Responsible for testing and developing GOES-R XRS algorithms and advising on calibration and ground system issues.
</li><li>
Worked with Michele Cash to develop an automated shock detection algorithm (Cash et al. 2014) and to test methods of estimating the L1 to Earth delay time (Cash et al. 2016).
</li>
</ul>
<h4>
    2008-2013: Research Scientist II. University of Colorado, based at SWPC/NOAA.
    </h4>
    <ul>
    <li>
Found evidence that subsurface changes in kinetic helicity precede flares by 2-3 days, providing a potential flare prediction technique (<a href = "https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2041-8205/710/2/L121/pdf" >Reinard et al. 2010</a>). 
</li><li>
Lead a team in a thorough analysis of the spatial structure and evolution of a series of CMEs including the development of a new method to extract ion composition information from MHD models of CME eruptions, new techniques for mapping the spatial structure of CMEs in-situ including the non-magnetic cloud portion and a comparison of the predicted and observed two dimensional ionic composition structure (Reinard et al. 2010, Lynch et al. 2011, Reinard et al. 2012, Mulligan et al. 2013).    
</li><li>
Worked with Josh Rigler to develop software based on the Bayesian method of machine learning to classify solar image data. The resulting maps will replace the hand-drawn maps currently in use at SWPC (Rigler et al. 2012).
</li><li>
Worked with Larisza Krista to relate dimmings, flares and CMEs and to describe the coronal magnetic field topology in terms of the dimming and surrounding field of the region (Krista and Reinard, 2013, 2016).
</li>
</ul>
<h4>
    2005-2008: Research Scientist I. University of Colorado, based at SWPC/NOAA.
    </h4>
<ul>
<li>
Developed a new image technique for measuring coronal dimming regions, did a statistical analysis of 100+ CME associated dimmings (Reinard & Biesecker 2008) and showed that fast CMEs always have associated dimmings (Reinard & Biesecker 2009)
</li><li>
Showed that charge state enhancements occur most often for magnetic cloud type CMEs and for CMEs that are intersected through the center (Reinard 2008)
</li><li>
Conducted calibration and developed processing software for the GOES/XRS and SXI instruments (Reinard et al. 2007)
</li>
</ul>
<h4>
2002-2004: Postdoctoral Fellow.  Space Science Division, Naval Research Laboratory. 
</h4>
<ul>
<li>
Compared CME characteristics from the ACE spacecraft with SOHO/LASCO images to determine the relationship between remote and in situ features (Reinard 2005)
</li><li>
Examined CME/flare time delays during SEP and non-SEP events (Reinard & Andrews 2006)
</li>
</ul>

<h4>
1997-2002: Doctoral Student.  Departments of Physics and Atmospheric, Oceanic and Space Sciences, University of Michigan.   Thesis advisors:  Drs. Len Fisk and Thomas Zurbuchen
</h4>
<ul>
<li>
Analyzed ion charge states in CME ejecta and the slow solar wind (Reinard et al. 2001, Burlaga et al. 2001)
</li><li>
Developed a model describing the reconnection of CME magnetic field lines near the solar surface during propagation. Model was validated by comparison to in situ data (Reinard and Fisk 2004)  
</li><li>
Decoded raw telemetry from the SWICS instrument onboard the WIND spacecraft. 
</li><li>
Determined the water production rates of comets Hale-Bopp, Bradfield, and Austin based on Hydrogen Lyman-alpha brightness measurements (Combi et al. 2000) 
</li>
</ul>
<h4>
1993-1997: Undergraduate researcher.  Department of Geophysics, University of Washington, Seattle, WA. Advised by Drs. George Parks and Ruth Skoug.
</h4>
<ul>
<li>
Studied the qualities of auroral microburst precipitation, including frequency, duration, shape and energy spectral characteristics (<a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1029/97GL00377">Reinard et al. 1997</a>)
</li><li>
Developed a forward model to compare electron energy spectra with resulting X-ray spectra, including a correction for photoelectric absorption of X-rays in the atmosphere
</li><li>
Calibrated photomultiplier tubes and repaired instrumentation related to Fabry-Perot interferometers. 
</li>
</ul>
