    <h3>This app lets you combine your Spotify playlists into a single playlist.  Maybe you have multiple dance mixes you want to combine.
        Maybe you want a mix of country and rap. Whatever works for you.  </h3>
        <h3>All exact duplicates are removed.  You can also (optionally) add any playlists you don't want to play.  
            Maybe your dance mix from last December has some songs from your Christmas playlist and it's February.</h3>
        <h3>Lastly you choose the name of the new playlist -- you'll want to create this empty playlist in advance 
            or select one you don't use.  (Mine is called "Today's Mix!").  <span style="color:red">NOTE: anything currently in this 
                playlist will be DELETED.</span>
        </h3>
        <h3>This app will only work if you have a Spotify premium account.</h3>
